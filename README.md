# Bignum Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Bignum Project repository! This project originated during my high school years as part of my participation in the National Informatics Olympiad of Iran. The Bignum Project focuses on providing a robust implementation of large integer arithmetic, crucial for various algorithmic and computational tasks. Whether you're working on cryptographic algorithms, numerical simulations, or any application requiring arithmetic operations on large integers, this library is designed to meet your needs.

## Key Features

- **Arithmetic Operations:** Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on large integers with efficiency and precision.

- **Modular Arithmetic:** Support for modular arithmetic operations, essential for cryptographic applications.

- **Optimized Algorithms:** The library is implemented using efficient algorithms to ensure optimal performance on large numbers.

- **Easy Integration:** Simple and intuitive API for seamless integration into your projects.

## Background

This project was initially conceived during my high school years while participating in the National Informatics Olympiad of Iran. It has since evolved into a comprehensive library for handling large integer arithmetic.
